CÉU-Media
===
This project aims to create a high-level API for developing multimedia
applications using the [CÉU](http://www.ceu-lang.org/) language.
The main goal is to explore the reactive/synchronous execution model of the
language to create deterministic multimedia applications. 

One of the advantages of our framework is the deterministic control of the
passage of time, which makes enables one to match the application logic time
with the presentation time.
